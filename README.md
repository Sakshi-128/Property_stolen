# Property_stolen
This dataset provides cleaned crime data with 1000 rows, focusing on property stolen and recovered. All original columns are retained. We introduced a few null values in 'Cases_Property_Recovered' to simulate real-world data issues. It is ideal for data preprocessing, handling missing values, and analysis tasks.
